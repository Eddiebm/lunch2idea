## Handoff checklist (both tiers)

Before marking an order complete:

- [ ] Live URL resolves over HTTPS
- [ ] Custom domain connected and propagated (or customer notified it's in progress)
- [ ] Confirmation email sent with live URL
- [ ] WhatsApp message sent if number was provided
- [ ] GitHub repo transferred (Full Product only)
- [ ] Vercel project transferred (Full Product only)
- [ ] Supabase project transferred (Full Product only)
- [ ] Loom walkthrough sent (Full Product only)
- [ ] 30-day support window start date recorded in Redis order record

## What the $97/mo covers

- Domain renewal (prorated, ~$2.40/mo of the $97)
- Vercel hosting (cost: $0 — covered by our plan)
- Uptime monitoring (ping every 5 min, auto-alert)
- One content update per month: text changes, new photo, swap a section (up to 1 hour)
- Security patches if Next.js/framework CVEs require a redeploy

**Does not cover:**
- New pages or features
- Design changes
- A second domain
- Moving to a different hosting provider

Cancellation: customer keeps their site files and GitHub repo. Domain transfers out at cost (~$10). Hosting goes dark 30 days after last paid month unless they self-host.

## Scope creep rules

1. Any request that takes more than 30 minutes gets a quote before we touch it.
2. "Can you just add X" during build = out of scope. Quote it separately.
3. If the brief changes after payment, the 48-hour clock resets from the change confirmation.
4. One round of edits is included. A second round is $49 flat.

## What we do NOT promise

- A specific Lighthouse score
- First-page Google ranking
- Conversion rate outcomes
- Uptime SLA beyond "best effort" (no credits for downtime)
- Compatibility with every browser (support: Chrome, Safari, Firefox — last 2 major versions)
